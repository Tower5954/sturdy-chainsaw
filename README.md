The beginning of a facial recognition model


This first commit is not too good. The prediction is way off and depending if im waering glasses or not I get a prediction of either Colin Powell or Serena Williams (I am a white man with a beard)? 

I have been informed on a new model that I will try adjusting with. 09/12/20
